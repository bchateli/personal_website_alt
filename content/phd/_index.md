## PhD work

My PhD work _Model-based learning for high-dimensional wireless systems_ focused on bridging model-based methods (signal processing) and learning methods (machine learning) using the model-based machine learning paradigm in wireless communication problems.

The manuscript is not available yet, but the slides cant be found here [HTML](https://baptistechatelier.com/_PhD_defense/slides.html) (HTML format, requires the [Free Sans font](https://font.download/font/freesans-2) for a better experience).
